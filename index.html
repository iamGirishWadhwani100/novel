    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page interactive dashboard. The main navigation allows users to explore the story via a Plot Timeline, Character Profiles, and a guide to the Legendary Crystals. This non-linear structure is chosen to encourage exploration and deeper engagement with the story's lore and characters, rather than a simple passive reading experience. The timeline provides the core narrative, while other sections offer context on demand. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Plot -> Goal:Change -> Interactive Timeline (HTML/CSS/JS) -> User clicks to reveal chapter summaries. Characters -> Goal:Inform -> Clickable Cards (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Displays character bios and roles. Lore (Crystals) -> Goal:Organize -> Interactive Icons (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Shows details of each crystal. This approach breaks the novel down into its core components, making the information digestible and interactive. -->

                { chapter: 1, title: "The Meeting and the Aftermath", content: "<p>The great hall was dark as a starless night. Around a darkwood table sat the last rebels in a multiverse that had learned to kneel, united by a single cause: the end of Devil Danger, the conqueror of worlds. Suddenly, the great obsidian doors groaned open. A figure stood silhouetted in the doorway. The voice of Devil Danger came from the shadow, a low rumble that seemed to shake the foundations of the hall. “I was told there was a conspiracy. I’m disappointed.”</p><p>His brother, Michael, pushed through the crowd. “Brother, you shouldn’t be here,” he hissed. “Something else is coming.” Devil Danger scoffed. “Let it come.” As if summoned, the gates disintegrated and a new figure stepped through the ruin: the Angel of Death. “I am here to correct your mistake,” she said, turning the council table to dust. “Your Dino World will burn.”</p><p>Before she could strike, a woman landed between them, a shield of pure, blinding light shimmering into existence. “Run!” she shouted. Michael grabbed his brother and pulled him away as the Angel of Death's dark power slammed into the bright shield.</p><hr class='my-6 border-gray-300'/><p>They landed hard on the twilight plains of Dino World. “Who was that woman?” Devil Danger demanded. Before Michael could answer, their mysterious savior staggered through a portal and collapsed. “She burned through all her power,” Michael said grimly. “The Angel of Death is far stronger than we imagined.”</p><p>For days, the woman remained unconscious in a recovery chamber. One day, Michael heard her whisper in her sleep, “...I will save you, Devil Danger… and one day, you’ll love me.” When she awoke, she introduced herself as Arora, from the lost Crystal Planet. She explained she held the Pure Crystal, powered by love. 'It and the Angel of Death's Dark Crystal are two of the Six Legendary Crystals from my home world,' she told Michael, her voice filled with awe. 'They are incredibly powerful.' Devil Danger, who had been listening from the shadows, stepped forward. “You served her?” he asked, his voice cold. “How do we know you’re not a spy?” He turned and walked out, leaving a heavy mistrust in his wake.</p>" },
                { chapter: 2, title: "Testimony Under Oath", content: "<p>Michael followed his brother. “You can’t be serious,” he argued. “She risked her life for you!” Devil Danger’s expression was carved from stone. “Fine. We will learn the truth. Take her to the Demon’s Room.”</p><p>They escorted Arora down into a chamber where no lie could survive. Blue flames flickered from torches. “Speak,” Devil Danger commanded.</p><p>Arora told her story. As a child, a demon attacked her. She was frozen in fear, but Devil Danger appeared, destroying the demon before vanishing. He never even saw her, but he had saved her life. From that day, she sought to be strong like him. She found the Angel of Death and asked to be trained, believing their cause was the same. But she overheard the Angel’s true plan: to destroy Devil Danger and every world he’d touched. That is when Arora fled to find and warn him.</p><p>The blue flames flared, confirming her story was true. Michael looked at his brother, who remained silent for a long time. His pride would not let him admit he believed her. “We’ll continue this later,” he said, and strode from the chamber.</p>" },
                { chapter: 3, title: "A Summons to the Past", content: "<p>After days of silence, Michael found Devil Danger's chamber in the high tower. The room was a wreck, a reflection of a tormented mind. 'It's been days,' Michael said, his voice cutting through the gloom. 'Are you ready to talk?'</p><p>Devil Danger turned from the window, his eyes heavy. 'Yes. I'm ready. You were right about Arora. She's on our side.' He paused. 'I didn't want to admit it, because then I would have to tell you what I was truly doing on the Crystal Planet.' He straightened up, a new resolve in his eyes. 'Bring Arora to the City Hall. It's time you both knew everything.'</p><p>Michael was taken aback. 'The City Hall? But you despise that place. You haven't set foot in there for centuries.' The City Hall was the sacred place where the first king of Dino World received his power, a place Devil Danger had always avoided.</p><p>'You will understand soon enough,' Devil Danger replied. 'Just bring her. It is time.'</p><hr class='my-6 border-gray-300'/><p>Michael found Arora in the Demon's Room, where she had been staying. 'It's time,' he said. 'Devil Danger has a plan, and it begins at the City Hall.' Arora looked up, her expression a mixture of hope and apprehension. 'The place he hates most? Then we must go at once.'</p><p>Meanwhile, Devil Danger stood before the grand, ancient doors of the City Hall. He took a deep breath, steeling himself. 'They have to know,' he muttered to himself. 'They have to know why I was there.'</p>" },
                { chapter: 4, title: "The Crystal Prince", content: "<p>When Michael and Arora arrived, Devil Danger stood waiting in the vast, echoing hall. 'Here she is,' Michael announced. 'Now, tell us. Why this place?'</p><p>'Michael... I'm sorry for not telling you this before,' Devil Danger began. 'It's time you knew why I am so different from you.' 'What are you talking about?' Michael asked, confused. 'This is about Arora, isn't it? Not our family history.' 'It's all connected,' Devil Danger replied grimly. 'Just listen.'</p><p>He turned to Arora. 'Your story was true. I was on the Crystal Planet, and I saved you. I tried to erase your memory of that day, but the Pure Crystal must have protected you.' He took a deep breath. 'I am not from Dino World. I was adopted. I was born on the Crystal Planet.' A gasp escaped Arora. 'I was its prince. And you,' he said, his gaze locking with hers, 'are my sister. A princess.'</p><p>He explained that their father, the King, feared a prophecy that his children would steal his power. 'He cast me out because of my demonic appearance. The king of Dino World found me and raised me as his heir. Years later, he told me the truth.' Devil Danger's voice grew hard. 'I went back to the Crystal Planet in disguise. I confronted our father. I threatened to shatter his kingdom. I told him, <strong>I don't need my sister's hand to destroy this planet. I alone can do it.</strong>'</p><p>'He was a coward. He offered me the location of a Legendary Crystal if I would leave. He told me it was on Dragon's Mountain. It was on my way there that I found you being attacked, and I knew who you were.' He paused. 'After I found the stone, I went back to the king. I told him I had the crystal, and that I had seen you, my sister. I told him I had placed a dark curse upon him: if you ever left the planet, your absence would cause it to crumble to dust. He didn't believe me.' Devil Danger's voice cracked with a pain he had hidden for centuries. 'And after you were gone... it was destroyed. My curse came true.' He then gestured to the hall around them. 'The crystal our father spoke of... it is here. Hidden in this City Hall, obtainable only by passing trials that I created long ago. Trials that now, even I must face.'</p>" }
